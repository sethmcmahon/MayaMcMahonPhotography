		<WriteUpParagraph1>Ethan and Hailey were married on Saturday at the beautiful Blacksburg Country Club. It rained on and off most of the morning, but luckily stopped a half hour before the ceremony. Hailey and Ethan brought sand from the beach where they got engaged to use in their sand ceremony. After the ceremony, we were able to steal away to the golf course to take pictures with the mist covered mountains in the background.</WriteUpParagraph1>
		<WriteUpParagraph2>The entire evening was so much fun to be a part of from the father of the bride squealing the golf cart tires announcing the brideâ€™s arrival, to playing with sparklers as the evening drew to a close. These two are such a cute couple and it was an honor to be able to preserve their wedding memories. Congratulations Mr. and Mrs. Dickerson.</WriteUpParagraph2>
